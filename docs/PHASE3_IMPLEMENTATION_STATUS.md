- **Features:**
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Connection status monitoring
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Error handling and recovery

### ✅ 3. Custom Bus Markers with Information
- **Bus Markers:** Custom HTML elements with CSS styling
- **Information Displayed:**
  - Bus number/name
  - Current speed (calculated from location updates)
  - ETA to next stop (placeholder for PostGIS integration)
  - Interactive popups with detailed information

### ✅ 4. Bus Filtering by Route and Location
- **Route Filtering:** Dropdown to filter buses by route
- **Location Filtering:** Find buses near user location
- **Proximity Search:** 5km radius search functionality
- **Real-time Updates:** Filters update as buses move

### ✅ 5. Loading & Error States
- **Loading States:** Spinner during map and WebSocket initialization
- **Error States:** Connection error overlays with retry options
- **Network Handling:** Graceful degradation for network failures
- **User Feedback:** Clear status indicators

### ✅ 6. Optimized Map Rendering
- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - `useCallback` for event handlers
  - `useMemo` for filtered data
  - Efficient marker management
  - Minimal re-renders
- **Memory Management:** Proper cleanup of markers and event listeners

## 🔧 Dependencies Added

### Frontend Dependencies
```json
{
  "maplibre-gl": "^3.3.0",
  "socket.io-client": "^4.7.5",
  "@types/geojson": "^0.0.40"
}
```

### Backend Dependencies

## 🚀 Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the System
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Implementation
1. **Open Browser:** Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Access Student Map:** Click "Student Map (Live Tracking)"
3. **Verify Map Loading:** Check if OpenStreetMap tiles load
4. **Check WebSocket:** Verify connection status shows "Connected"
5. **Test Driver Interface:** Open `/driver` in another tab
6. **Send Location Updates:** Use driver interface to send GPS coordinates
7. **Observe Real-time Updates:** Watch bus markers appear and move on map
8. **Test Filtering:** Use route filter and location features

### 3. Expected Behavior

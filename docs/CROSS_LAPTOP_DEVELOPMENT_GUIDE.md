  ➜  press h to show help
```

### 3. **Verify Network Access**

Open the network test client in your browser:
```
http://192.168.1.2:5173/network-test-client.html
```

## 📱 Client Laptop Setup (Testing Machine)

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd College-Project
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. **Test Network Connectivity**

Open the network test client:
```
http://192.168.1.2:5173/network-test-client.html
```

Or access the main application:
```
http://192.168.1.2:5173/
```

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### **Backend Configuration**

The backend is configured to:
- Bind to `0.0.0.0:3000` (all network interfaces)
- Allow CORS from network IPs in the `192.168.x.x` range
- Support WebSocket connections from network clients

**Key Files:**
- `backend/src/config/environment.ts` - CORS and network configuration
- `backend/src/server.ts` - Server binding configuration

### **Frontend Configuration**

The frontend is configured to:
- Bind to `0.0.0.0:5173` (all network interfaces)
- Automatically detect network IPs and connect to the backend
- Support both localhost and network access

**Key Files:**
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` - Development server configuration
- `frontend/src/config/environment.ts` - Dynamic API URL detection

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### **1. Basic Connectivity Test**

Use the network test client to verify:
- ✅ Backend health check
- ✅ WebSocket connection
- ✅ API endpoints
- ✅ CORS headers
- ✅ Network latency

### **2. Cross-Browser Testing**

Test the application in different browsers:
- **Chrome** - Primary testing browser
- **Firefox** - WebSocket compatibility testing
- **Safari** - Mobile compatibility testing
- **Edge** - Windows compatibility testing

### **3. Mobile Device Testing**

Access the application from mobile devices:
```
http://192.168.1.2:5173/
```

### **4. Real-time Features Testing**

Test real-time functionality:
- Bus location updates
- WebSocket connections
- Live map updates
- Driver-student communication

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Connection Issues**

**Problem:** Cannot connect to backend from client laptop

**Solutions:**
1. Check firewall settings on host laptop
2. Verify both laptops are on the same network
3. Check if the backend is binding to `0.0.0.0:3000`
4. Test with the network test client

**Problem:** CORS errors

**Solutions:**
1. Verify CORS configuration in `backend/src/config/environment.ts`
2. Check if client IP is in the allowed origins list
3. Clear browser cache and cookies

**Problem:** WebSocket connection fails

**Solutions:**
1. Check WebSocket CORS configuration
2. Verify firewall allows WebSocket connections
3. Test with different browsers
4. Check network latency and stability

### **Network Configuration Issues**

**Problem:** Cannot find the host laptop

**Solutions:**
1. Check IP address with `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux)
2. Ensure both laptops are on the same subnet
3. Try using the host laptop's IP address directly
4. Check if the host laptop's firewall is blocking connections

### **Port Issues**

**Problem:** Port already in use

**Solutions:**
1. Change the port in configuration files
2. Kill processes using the port
3. Use `strictPort: false` in Vite config for automatic fallback

## 📊 Network Test Client Features

# 🔧 ROLLUP MODULE FIX REPORT

## 📊 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Status:** ✅ **NETLIFY BUILD FAILURE SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED**

**Issue:** Missing `@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu` module causing build failure
**Solution:** Added Rollup Linux binary as optional dependency
**Result:** Build now passes successfully on Netlify

---

## 🚨 **ORIGINAL ERROR ANALYSIS**

### **❌ Build Failure Details**

**Platform:** Netlify (Linux build environment)
**Error Type:** Missing Rollup module
**Exit Code:** 1 (Build script returned non-zero exit code)
**Node.js Version:** v18.20.8

### **❌ Specific Error Message**

```
Error: Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu. 
npm has a bug related to optional dependencies (https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828). 
Please try `npm i` again after removing both package-lock.json and node_modules directory.
```

### **❌ Root Cause**

The build failure was caused by a missing platform-specific Rollup binary (`@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu`) that's required for Vite to function properly in Linux-based build environments like Netlify. This is a common issue when developing on Windows/macOS and deploying to Linux servers.

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **🔧 Code Changes Made**

#### **1. Added Optional Dependencies**
```diff
  "devDependencies": {
    // ... existing dependencies
  },
+ "optionalDependencies": {
+   "@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu": "^4.6.0"
+ }
```

#### **2. Added Node.js Engine Specification**
```diff
  "name": "bus-tracking-frontend",
  "private": true,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
+ "engines": {
+   "node": ">=18.0.0"
+ },
  "scripts": {
```

### **🔧 Technical Details**

**Rollup Version:** `^4.6.0` (compatible with Vite 5.x)
**Platform:** Linux x64 GNU (required for Netlify build environment)
**Dependency Type:** Optional (only installed when needed)
